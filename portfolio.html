                <hr>
                <p>In this project we had to build a page that will make it easier for the new interns at the zoo to identify
                    each animal and understand their needs and behaviors. All major HTML semantic tags had to be incorporated.
                    The webpage had to include a title, a heading for each animal type, a description of each animal, and the names of some of the animals in listed format.
                    It also had to include a link that goes to an external fact page for each animal.
